RAJH  completed by Robbie Behm, Andrew Carter, Jenni Ferguson, Hunter Estes


This project took many twists and turns.  We started with Postgres and completed an entire backend and routes and unable to connect to the front end. At one point we each recreated the project to assist eachother and tried to come together. 

We were able to utilize Git hub with the branches and merging, however, came to a stand still when we wanted to switch databases.  We wanted to show our full effort on this project.

We are able to retrieve the category data and display in POSTMAN with the following routes:
http://localhost:5005/api/products/products/Womens
http://localhost:5005/api/products/products/Mens
http://localhost:5005/api/products/products/Childrens

We were also able to do this in our inital PERN stack as well - all controllers were functional.


Future enhancements for this project would contain filtering data by category and displaying this on the CategoryScreen.  Being able to add more than one style of glasses in the cart, as well as, customer log in and purchasing of the product.

Our Feedback:  

We feel that we focused too much on the larger project idea then focusing in on the smaller parts.  This was influenced by having 4 people in a group structure and we would advise that it be kept to 2 for numreous reasons.

Another consideration is to have the students in groups both be on the same operating system.  WE ran into issues working back and forth with merging issues and it always had to with mac vs window.
